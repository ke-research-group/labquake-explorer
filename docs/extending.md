# Extending Labquake Explorer

## Adding a view

1. Create `labquake_explorer/ui/views/<name>_view.py` with a class deriving from
   `EventView` (one event), `RunView` (one run) or `BaseView` (anything else)
   from `labquake_explorer/ui/views/base.py`.
2. Decorate it with `@register_view(label, kinds=[...])` from
   `labquake_explorer/ui/actions.py`. `kinds` are tree-node kinds from
   `labquake_explorer/ui/context.py` (`EVENT`, `RUN`, `RUN_ARRAY`,
   `EVENT_ARRAY`, `EVENT_EXTRACTION`, `ARRAY`, `STRING`). The main window builds
   the right-click menu for a node from the registry; nothing else to edit.
3. Import the module in `labquake_explorer/ui/views/__init__.py` so it is
   registered at start-up.
4. Put numerics in `labquake_explorer/analysis/` as pure functions (arrays in,
   dataclass or JSON-like dict out; never raise on degenerate data, return a
   `valid` flag and a reason) and test them with synthetic signals in `tests/`
   (`tests/synthetic.py` builds stick-slip runs with known answers).

```python
from labquake_explorer.ui.actions import register_view
from labquake_explorer.ui.context import EVENT
from labquake_explorer.ui.views.base import EventView

@register_view("My Analysis", kinds=[EVENT], order=50)
class MyView(EventView):
    window_title = "My Analysis"
    result_key = "my_analysis"          # saved under runs/[r]/events/[e]/my_analysis

    def build_ui(self):                 # widgets; call self.build_event_selector(frame, row=0, column=0)
        ...
        self.make_figure(figsize=(8, 5), row=2, column=0, sticky="nsew")

    def on_event_loaded(self):          # refresh from self.event; self.load_results() gives the saved dict
        ...

    def save(self):
        self.save_results({"version": 1, ...})   # writes the dict and refreshes the tree
```

`EventView` provides `run_idx`, `event_idx`, `event`, `event_path`, `set_event()`,
the event combobox, `load_results()` / `save_results()`, `make_figure()`,
`toolbar_active()` (ignore drags while pan/zoom is on) and `on_close()`.
`RunView` provides `run_idx`, `run`, `run_path`, `load_results()` /
`save_results()` under `runs/[r]/<result_key>`, `make_figure()`,
`toolbar_active()`, `on_close()` and the hook `on_run_loaded()` (called once
the run is loaded; there is no event selector and no `on_event_loaded()`).

A menu command that is not a window registers a function instead:

```python
@register_action("Do Something", kinds=[RUN_ARRAY])
def do_something(app, ctx): ...       # ctx.path, ctx.run_idx, ctx.event_idx, ctx.key
```

## Data rule

Raw extracted data lives at the top level of an event. Each analysis view
(`event_analysis`, `slip_analysis`, `interevent`, `spectrum`, `source_scaling`) writes only
under its own key, and every saved dict carries a `version` integer, the
inputs needed to reproduce the numbers, and outputs with units in the key
names. Cross-view reads go through the other view's key.

Two older views predate the rule and are kept as they are so existing files
stay readable: Pick Arrivals writes into the event's raw layout (see its
schema below) and `czm_parms` carries no `version`.

## Run layout

A run built by the preprocessing package (`labquake_explorer/preprocessing/`)
looks like this:

| key | content |
|---|---|
| `time` | 1-D, seconds on the run clock |
| `elsys`, `ni`, ... | one block per recorder: its raw-file reference (next section) plus `raw_data`, the channel array of the voltages it recorded: `data` (channels x samples, float32), `channels` (`pzt_1`, `pressure_1`, `eddy_3`, ...), `unit` (`V`), `positions` |
| `normal_stress`, `shear_stress`, `friction`, `LP_displacement` | 1-D physical channels (MPa, um, ...). PSU-era files also have `displacement` (fault slip); without it the views take the first `slip` channel |
| `slip` | channel array of the eddy-current sensors in um: `data`, `channels` (`slip_1`...), `source` (the voltage channel of each row), `slope_mm_per_v`, `positions` |
| `units` | unit of every top-level array and channel array |
| `calibration` | the steps that produced the physical channels (see the preprocessing package) |
| `event_extraction`, `events` | the Pick Events form's record, with the picks (`event_indices`) inside (schema below), and the extracted events |

Everything a view stores for the whole experiment goes into one dict next to
`runs`, `analysis` (`labquake_explorer/data/settings.py`: `get_setting`,
`set_setting`), so the top level keeps to the metadata the preprocessing
wrote (`name`, `date`, `sample`, a `fault` description, ...):

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `analysis['fault']` | `patch_x_mm = [from, to]`, the edges of the bare PMMA patch along the fault in mm (in either order), and `ends_x_mm = [from, to]`, where the fault (the sample) ends, both in the frame of the sensor positions. The Slip Distribution view draws them, cuts the slip profile at the ends and can save both; a notebook sets them with `experiment(..., analysis={'fault': {'patch_x_mm': [x0, x1], 'ends_x_mm': [0, 500]}})`. A value without two finite, different numbers is not drawn, and the view says it is unusable |
| `analysis['medium']` | `rho_kg_m3`, `vp_m_s`, `vs_m_s` of the sample, as last saved by the PZT Spectrum view and offered to every new window |
| `analysis['pzt_spectrum']` | the PZT Spectrum view's `settings` (its controls as last saved, the keys of a `spectrum` record below plus `phase` and `radiation_coefficient`) and `sensors` (per sensor, keyed by the channel's field name such as `pzt_1`, else `ch<k>`: the `calibration` table, `calibration_path`, `calibration_unit`, `calibration_db`, `t_star_s`, `distance_m`, `free_surface_factor`) |

Files saved earlier kept the patch edges and fault ends as top-level
`patch_x_mm` / `fault_ends_x_mm` or as `fault = {'patch_x_mm': ...,
'ends_x_mm': ...}`; the view reads those and moves a value into `analysis`
when it saves.

A **channel array** (`labquake_explorer/data/channels.py`) is a dict with
`data` shaped `(n_channels, n)`, `channels` naming the rows, `unit`, and an
optional `positions` table (`x`, `y`, `z` per channel, NaN when unknown, plus
`unit` and `frame`). Any further key is metadata. Views address a row by its
path (`slip/slip_3`, `elsys/raw_data/pzt_1`); `aligned_fields(container, n)`
lists every 1-D series of length `n` this way and `get_field(container,
path)` resolves one, so a field is the same whether it is a top-level array
or a row. Event extraction slices channel arrays along the sample axis and
keeps their metadata: `slip` is sliced, the recorders' blocks (file reference
and `raw_data` volts) are not copied, and each recorder's full-rate record
becomes the channel array `waveform/<recorder>` (with `time`, `sample_rate`,
`filename` and, for a recorder that writes separate records, `block` and
`trigger_time`, where the recorder fired, on the run clock). Older files with
top-level 1-D channels keep working: a channel array is only an additional
place a field can live.

## Saved result schemas

### `event_extraction` (EventPickerView, run level, version 1)

What the Pick Events form last saved, and what it starts from when reopened:
`event_indices` (the picks, sample indices on the run's time axis), `start_s` and
`end_s` (the window around each pick, seconds, start negative), `x_field` and
`y_field` (the series shown), `n_events` (how many events the last Extract
wrote). Save picks updates `event_indices` only; Extract writes the whole
record. Older files that kept `event_indices` at the run's top level (and the
window under `event_window`) are read; saving moves both into the record.
`labquake_explorer/data/picks.py` gives readers `picked_indices(run)` for
either layout.

### `event_analysis` (EventAnalyzerView, version 3)

Six picked samples on the event slice and what they give on the chosen
fields, nothing more. The numbers are slopes and differences of whatever
`x_field` and `y_field` were: with fault slip on X and shear stress on Y the
slopes are stiffnesses, `delta_x` the coseismic slip and `-delta_y` the
stress drop.

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `version` | 3 |
| `x_field`, `y_field` | the fields plotted |
| `loading_indices`, `unloading_indices` | inclusive index ranges of the two slopes |
| `delta_indices` | the two samples differenced (start, end) |
| `loading_slope`, `unloading_slope` | dY/dX by least squares over each range (NaN when degenerate) |
| `delta_x`, `delta_y` | X and Y at `delta_indices[1]` minus at `delta_indices[0]` |

Version 1 and 2 records (`rupture_start_index`/`rupture_end_index`,
`stress_drop`, `displacement`, trend fits) are still read for their picks;
the inter-event and scaling views take `displacement`/`stress_drop` from
them and `delta_x`/`-delta_y` from version 3. "Apply to All Events" turns
the current picks into times relative to the event, places them on every
event of the run and saves each result.

### `slip_analysis` (SlipDistributionView, version 2)

Coseismic slip of every sensor of a slip channel array (`field`, normally
`slip`), each sensor with its own event time `t_i`
(`labquake_explorer/analysis/coseismic_slip.py`). Top-level lists hold one
entry per sensor, in the order of `channels`, except `patch_x_mm`
(`[from, to]`); inside `profile` and `front` only `use` is per sensor.

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `version` | 2 (version 1 gave the fit windows relative to `t_i`; they are moved to the event time when read) |
| `field`, `unit`, `channels`, `x_mm` | the channel array analysed, its unit (um), its rows and the sensor positions along the fault |
| `event_time`, `start_s`, `end_s` | the event time and the extraction window the default fit windows came from |
| `time_method` | per sensor: `max_rate` (largest filtered slip rate), `onset` (where the rate, followed back from that peak, last rose through `onset_fraction` of it, default 0.2), `step` (where the slip crosses `step_fraction`, default 0.5, of the way from the before to the after line, between the windows), `shared` (one t_i for all: `event_time + shared_shift_s`, or the reference time when that is NaN) or `manual` (set by hand); `onset` and `step` interpolate between samples, and keep the max-rate pick, flagged, when they find no crossing |
| `onset_fraction`, `step_fraction`, `shared_shift_s`, `shared_set_s` | the settings of those methods; `shared_set_s` is the value typed in the view's Shared tab, kept while the reference is used |
| `t_shift_s` | `t_i - event_time` |
| `rate_filter`, `rate_cutoff_hz`, `rate_lowpass_type`, `rate_lowpass_order`, `rate_savgol_order`, `rate_smoothing_s`, `search_halfwidth_s`, `rate_snr`, `reference_halfwidth_s` | `max_rate` settings: the slip-rate filter (the view's filter tab shown), `lowpass` (the default: the slip through a `butterworth` (default) or `bessel` low-pass of order `rate_lowpass_order` (4) at `rate_cutoff_hz` (50), run forwards and backwards for zero phase, then the derivative), `savgol` (Savitzky-Golay derivative of polynomial order `rate_savgol_order` (2) over the window `rate_smoothing_s`; the view's default 0.02) or `boxcar` (the derivative averaged over `rate_smoothing_s`, default 0.01; records without `rate_filter` were made with it); `rate_smoothing_s` is the window of the filter used; NaN gaps are bridged for the filter and blanked again; search half-width around the reference time (0.05), flag threshold in units of the rate noise (5), half-width around the event time in which the reference time is found (0.5) |
| `t_ref_shift_s` | reference time minus event time: the peak of the mean slip rate of all sensors within `event_time +- reference_halfwidth_s`; each sensor's `max_rate` pick is searched within `search_halfwidth_s` of it |
| `fit_before_s`, `fit_after_s` | `[start, end]` of the two fit windows, relative to `event_time` (moving `t_i` leaves them in place); defaults 75 %..25 % of the negative side and 25 %..75 % of the positive side of the extraction window |
| `same_windows` | the view applies a window edit to every sensor |
| `before_line`, `after_line` | `[slope (um/s), value at t_i (um)]` of the two least-squares lines |
| `coseismic_slip_um` | after-line minus before-line at `t_i` |
| `noise_um` | standard deviation of the residuals of the before-window line (two degrees of freedom removed): the sensor's per-sample noise, used as the error bar of the slip |
| `peak_rate_um_s` | filtered slip rate at `t_i` |
| `rate_noise_um_s` | standard deviation of the filtered slip rate in the before window; a `max_rate` peak below `rate_snr` times this is flagged `weak rate peak` |
| `flags` | one text per sensor, `"; "`-joined: `pick at search edge`, `weak rate peak`, `no rate peak`, `no crossing found` (onset or step), `before/after window clipped` (the window runs past the data), `before/after window has gaps` (less than half of its samples are finite), `before/after window reaches t_i` (`t_i` lies inside the window), `before/after fit invalid` |
| `rate_filter_tabs`, `fault_ends_x_mm` | the windows of both windowed filter tabs (`savgol_window_s`, `boxcar_window_s`), whichever is used; the fault ends the profile was cut at (NaN when none; the experiment's `analysis['fault']['ends_x_mm']` wins when the view opens) |
| `patch_x_mm` | the bare PMMA patch edges drawn, `[from, to]` (NaN when none). An event opens with the experiment's `analysis['fault']['patch_x_mm']` (see Run layout), else with this copy; edges typed in the view and not saved to the experiment stay as it moves between events. The copy counts towards "differs from the saved record" only while the experiment has no edges |
| `profile` | slip profile fit (`labquake_explorer/analysis/slip_profile.py`): `model` (`quadratic`, `eaz` or `eaz_asymmetric`), `params`, `valid`, `reason`, `n` (the sensors fitted: those in `use` with a finite slip and, when weighted, a positive `sigma`), `weighted`, `r2`, `rms_um`, `tips_mm` (where the fitted profile reaches zero), `peak_x_mm`, `peak_um`, `at_bounds`, `unresolved` (the parameters the sensors do not pin down, and `tips` when a rupture edge is only bracketed), `ranges` (name to `[lo, hi]`, the values that fit equally well where known, NaN for an open end; `tip_minus`/`tip_plus` are the brackets of free edges, and an EAZ `D` that moves with a free `lambda` has a range without being listed), `fixed` (the parameters held at the user's values), `end_slip_um` (the profile at the two fault ends where it reaches them, else NaN), `settings` (every model tab's parameters: per model and name, `fit` false for a held one, `value` the held value, `min`/`max` the user's bounds, NaN for automatic), and `use` (the sensors chosen) |
| `front` | rupture-front fit of `t_shift_s` (`t_i - event_time`) against `x`: `mode` (`single` or `bilateral`, below), `valid`, `reason`, `split_x_mm` and `t0_s` (bilateral: the apex and its time relative to `event_time`; NaN when there is none), `segments` (`x_from`, `x_to`, `n`, `slope_s_per_mm`, `intercept_s` at x = 0 relative to `event_time`, `velocity_m_s` positive towards +x and infinite for a flat line, `r2`, `resolved` false when the front crosses the segment within one sample, and `min_speed_m_s`, the speed of crossing it in one sample: the lower bound of an unresolved one), `use` and `use_auto` (while true, `use` follows the pick flags: the sensors whose `t_i` is doubtful, flagged `pick at search edge`, `weak rate peak` or `no rate peak`, are left out) |

Profile models, with `x` in mm: `quadratic` is `max(0, c0 + c1 x + c2 x^2)`,
the mask being part of the model so that sensors outside the rupture sit on
the zero part; `eaz` is the earthquake arrest zone model of Ke, McLaskey &
Kammer (2021, GJI 224, 581), eq. 2, an ellipse of radius `lambda a` in the
middle and a `(a - r)^(3/2)` tip beyond `r_joint = a (sqrt(1 + 3 lambda^2) - 1)`
(parameters `D`, `xc`, `a`, `lambda`, `0 < lambda <= 1`); `eaz_asymmetric` is
eq. 3, the same with `a_minus`, `a_plus`, `lambda_minus`, `lambda_plus` on the
two sides of `xc`. Fits are bounded least squares from several starts,
unweighted unless `weighted` (then `1/sigma^2` with `sigma = noise_um`; a
sigma below 1e-6 of the median, a dead channel, is left out). A fit is invalid
when its profile stays within each sensor's sigma or it did not converge. The
sensors leave a parameter free when no sensor sees the part of the profile it
shapes: EAZ `lambda` when no sensor lies inside `r_joint` (any `lambda` up to the
value that puts `r_joint` at the nearest sensor fits equally), the extent and the
edges when no more sensors slip than the model has parameters.

The front is fitted to the `t_i` of the sensors in `use`, with the event's
sampling interval. `single` is one line. `bilateral` is a hinge, two lines that
meet at a fitted apex (`split_x_mm`, `t0_s`): least squares over the apex
position, at least four sensors and two on each side; with fewer sensors, two
lines through the earliest one; one line when both sides run the same way.

The view opens with `eaz`, unweighted, and `bilateral`; an event without a
record keeps the current model, weighting, mode and every tab's held values and
bounds, and uses every sensor with `use_auto` true; a record without `profile`
or `front` is read as those defaults, with every parameter fitted within the
automatic bounds. Each model has its own tab: a value typed for a parameter
holds it there (`fit_profile(..., fixed=...)`) and the others are fitted, a
bound typed replaces the automatic one (`bounds=...`), and with every
parameter held the profile is drawn without a fit. Held parameters count as
resolved.

### `arrivals` (Pick Arrivals, per record, version 1)

Pick Arrivals works on one full-rate record at a time (the Record selector:
`waveform/elsys`, `waveform/ni`, ... or the PSU `strain`), and its results
belong to that record, `event['waveform'][recorder]['arrivals']`, so strain
and PZT picks never overwrite each other:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `picked_idx` | picked arrival sample index per channel on the record's `time` |
| `arrival_time` | the picked arrival times (s, run clock), read by the PZT view's "picked arrival" trigger |
| `enabled_channels`, `fitting_channels` | one bool per channel: shown, and used in the `Cf` fit |
| `locations` | sensor position along the fault (mm) per channel, from the record's `positions` table |
| `rupture_speed` | fitted `Cf` in m/s; absent when the picks define no line |

The CZM fitter takes its default `Cf` from the strain record's `arrivals`.
The PSU `strain` layout keeps its historical keys (`strain/original/picked_idx`,
`strain/original/rupture_arrival_time`, `strain/enabled_channels`,
`strain/fitting_channels`, `strain/locations`, and `rupture_speed` at the
event level); `sources.read_arrivals(block, event)` and `write_arrivals`
hide the difference from the views.

### `czm_parms` (CZMFitterView, no version)

Dict with `Cf`, `y`, `Xc`, `Gc`, `x_min`, `x_tip`, `x_max`, `x_lim_min`,
`x_lim_max`, `strain_gauge`; `Cf` defaults to `|rupture_speed|` when Pick
Arrivals has saved one. A legacy list of eight values is still read.

### `interevent` (InterEventView, run level, version 1)

`delay_s`, `width_s`, `lp_field`, `slip_field`, `event_times`, `recurrence`,
`lp_after`, `slip_after`, `lp_per_cycle`, `slip_per_cycle`, `coseismic_slip`
(from each event's `event_analysis.delta_x`, `displacement` in older records, used only when that
analysis was computed on the same X field, recorded as `coseismic_field`;
events skipped for that reason are listed in `coseismic_skipped`), `creep`. Each event is
sampled by a mean over `width_s` starting `delay_s` after its `event_time`;
per-cycle values are differences between consecutive events; the first event
and any window outside the run are NaN.

### `spectrum` (PZTSpectrumView, per record, version 1)

Kept with the record it was computed on, `event['waveform'][recorder]['spectrum']`
(or `event['strain']['spectrum']` in PSU files), as
`{"version": 1, "channels": {"ch<k>": record}}`, one record per analysed
channel. The event-level `pzt_spectrum` map of older files is still read
and moves into the record on the next save or with the migration tool.
A record stores every control (trigger source and time, pre/post window and
noise window in ms, taper, baseline mode, step removal, calibration path/unit/dB,
t*, fit band, bins per decade, SNR threshold, n fixed, loss), the calibration
table itself (`calibration`: `Calibration.as_dict()` plus `gain_db`, how the
CSV was read; None when uncalibrated), the source entries as typed
(`source_inputs`: phase, `rho_kg_m3`, `vp_m_s`, `vs_m_s`, `distance_m`,
`radiation_coefficient`, `free_surface_factor`, None where blank), the binned
spectrum (`spectrum`: binned frequencies, amplitudes, noise, SNR, counts and
the window/taper/calibration metadata), the fit (`fit`: `omega0` in the
spectrum's units, `fc`, `n`, weighted rms of ln residuals, bins used, band
used, `converged`, `at_bounds`, `band_limited`, `valid`, `reason`) and, once
"Compute source" has run, `source` (phase, medium constants, distance,
radiation coefficient, free-surface factor, `seismic_moment_nm`, `mw`,
`source_radius_m`, `rupture_area_m2`, `stress_drop_pa`, `kR`, warnings).
Save also writes the controls, the medium and the sensor's own values to the
experiment's `analysis` dict (see Run layout), so a window on any other event
opens with them: the controls and the medium when the first channel shown has
no record, a sensor's calibration, t*, distance and free-surface factor
whenever its channel is selected without a record. The calibration is read
from the CSV when its path is typed or browsed (the dB flag follows the
header), kept as a table and used from the table afterwards, so a saved
file works without the CSV; the frame says what is loaded.
Calibration CSVs are recognised by header: the frequency column is any
`frequency`/`freq`/`f` column, with or without a unit (`Frequency (Hz)`,
`freq_kHz`; kHz is converted), the gain column is the one mentioning gain,
amplitude, response, ratio, dB, psi or calib (or the only other column), and a
`(dB)` header is honoured when the dB flag is left to auto. A `Q^-1(f)` table
(`freq_kHz,Qp_inv_median`) with a travel time gives the frequency-dependent
attenuation correction `exp(pi f T Q^-1(f))` inside the table's band.
Conventions: amplitude = |FFT(taper * x)| dt (one-sided, no coherent-gain
division); noise divided by sqrt(mean(taper^2)); calibration converts to a
displacement spectral density in m s and is masked outside the table; fit
`ln A = ln Omega0 - ln(1 + (f/fc)^n)` in `(ln Omega0, ln fc, n)` with n fixed
at 2 by default over log-binned, SNR-gated bins.

### `source_scaling` (SourceScalingView, run level, version 2)

Also `exclude_near_field` (whether records flagged near-field, kR < 3 at the
plateau frequency, were excluded from the fit; by default they are only
warned about).

The channel and Y variable used, quality-gating choice, OLS exponent with
standard error and bootstrap 16-84 range, reduced-major-axis exponent,
coefficient, r2, the fitted `(x, y)` pairs and their event indices, excluded
events with their flags, and the distinct medium/model constant sets of the
records used.

## File formats

"Save As" writes `.npz` (a pickled experiment dict) or `.h5`/`.hdf5`; any
other suffix is refused. Files are written to a temporary sibling and moved
into place once complete, so a failed save leaves the previous file intact.
In HDF5, dicts and lists become groups tagged with a `container` attribute
so digit-keyed dicts and lists round-trip as what they were (older files
without the tag treat a group keyed `0..n-1` as a list); `None` values are
dropped; a scalar string comes back as `str` and any string list as a
`list` (a one-element list stays a list); lists numpy cannot stack (ragged
arrays, mixed content) become a group with one entry per index.

## Raw-data references and event extraction

A run may point at the acquisition files it was built from so that **Extract
Events** reads the full-rate records around picked event times instead of
copying them into the experiment file. A reference is a top-level run entry, a
dict with a `format` key, handled by `labquake_explorer/data/sources.py`:

| format | class | file |
|---|---|---|
| `tpc5` | `Tpc5Source` | Elsys TranAX tpc5, single block or ECR dual mode (block 1 continuous, blocks 2.. around triggers) |
| `ni_npz` | `NINpzSource` | National Instruments recording saved as npz (`aiN.npy` members, `sample_rate`, `channels`, `trigger_sample_index`) |
| `tpc5_legacy` | `LegacyTpc5Source` | the PSU-era `strain` dict (`filename`, `time_offset`, `time`, `raw`; no `format` key) |

Reference keys name the recorder (`elsys`, `ni`); `strain` is the PSU-era
key. Every reference carries `filename` (relative to the experiment file),
`time_offset` (`t_run = t_file + time_offset`), `fields` (the run field each
file channel feeds) and optionally `event_fields` (subset copied into events)
and `event_window_s` (`[pre, post]` seconds, replacing the start/end typed in
the Pick Events form for that source). A `Tpc5Source` also stores the block table so the
explorer knows the trigger times without opening the file; an `NINpzSource`
stores the record's metadata. `open_source(ref, base_dir, run)` rebuilds the
reader; `source.read_window(t_from, t_to, fields)` returns samples on the run
clock, or None when no record covers the time (a tpc5 with trigger blocks only
answers inside a trigger block). `Tpc5Source` reads the first measurement
group only, with one block table for every channel, so `Tpc5Source.open`
raises `ValueError` listing what it cannot read (`tpc5.layout_problems`): more
than one measurement group, selected channels whose block numbers differ, or
blocks whose sample rate, sample count, `triggerSample` or
`triggerTimeSeconds` differ between the channels.

**Adding a recorder**: subclass `Source`, implement `time_history`,
`read_window`, `to_reference`/`from_reference` (and `trigger_times` if it has
any), decorate the class with `@register_source`, and write a synthetic-file
test next to `tests/test_sources.py`.

`EventProcessor.extract_events(run, indices, window, pre, post)` slices every
1-D run field aligned with `time` around each pick (the processed channels;
the recorders' blocks with their `raw_data` volts are not copied) and adds
`waveform/<recorder>`, the
full-rate record as a channel array (`data (n_channels, n)`, `channels`,
`unit`, `positions`, `time` on the run clock, `sample_rate`, `filename`,
`block`, `trigger_time`). Which samples make the record
is the source's decision, `Source.waveform(event_time, pre, post)`: a
recorder that writes separate records around triggers (tpc5 ECR mode) copies
one whole record per event, every sample from its first pre-trigger sample
to its last (never trimmed to the window), chosen by
`sources.select_trigger_block`: among the records containing the event time,
the one overlapping the chosen window most (the lower block number on a tie);
when none contains it, the record in the window nearest to the event time
(the gap between the event time and the record's span, then the nearer
trigger, then the lower block number); nothing when no record overlaps the
window. A continuous recorder (NI npz, single-block tpc5) copies the
window itself, its own `event_window_s` taking precedence. The references are
not copied into the event. Views find the records with
`sources.waveform_blocks(event)` (keys `waveform/<recorder>`, or `strain`)
and read them through `waveform_time`, `waveform_data`, `waveform_channels`
and `waveform_store` (where per-record picks such as `picked_idx` and
`rupture_arrival_time` are kept), so the PSU layout and the new one look the
same to them; the PZT Spectrum view offers every record and opens the one
with `pzt` channels, the strain-gauge views (arrival picker, CZM) open
`strain` when present, else the first record. Recorders with no record
overlapping the event window are listed in `notes`. The legacy layout keeps its
historical output (`time`/`raw` downsampled copies plus `original` with the
first 1 % removed as baseline).

**Checking the records of an experiment file** against its tpc5 files:

```bash
python -m labquake_explorer.data.check_blocks experiment.h5 [--base-dir DIR] [--csv rows.csv] [--fill] [--no-backup]
```

For every run with events and a `tpc5` reference it lists the raw file's
trigger blocks itself (every measurement group and channel, attributes and
shapes only), takes the window from `event_extraction` (`start_s`, `end_s`),
or from the event's own time axis when the run has no extraction window,
and prints one row per event: the blocks overlapping the window, the block
the event holds and the block the rule above expects, a status (`OK`,
`NOT LOADED`, `WRONG BLOCK`, `NO BLOCK` when no block overlaps the window),
the overlapping blocks not loaded (marked `(one-block rule)` when the rule
leaves them out) and flags (blocks crossing the window start or end,
`pre-trigger truncated` (a record that is not its whole block), trigger blocks
overlapping each other), then notes on each raw file (extra measurement
groups, channels whose blocks differ, other `.tpc5` files starting with the
same name, as TranAX split files would) and a summary. It exits with 1 when an
event is not loaded, holds another block or a truncated one, else with 2 when
a raw or experiment file cannot be read. `--fill` adds the expected record to
every event that has none, built by the event processor as an extraction
would, and saves the file, keeping a copy `<name>.before-fill.h5` unless
`--no-backup` (an existing copy is not overwritten); a record already in an
event is never replaced. An `.h5` file is read with h5py, only the values
needed, so a large file is checked in seconds.

## Preprocessing package

`labquake_explorer/preprocessing/` turns raw files into the experiment dict:

- `build.run_from_tpc5(path, channel_map, base_dir, calibration, ...)` and
  `build.run_from_tpc5_ni(tpc5_path, ni_path, elsys_map, ni_map, base_dir,
  calibration, ...)` produce run dicts (time history, volt fields, `units`,
  references under `elsys` / `ni`, `calibration` record); `run_from_sources` is the general form
  (any sources, one of them the time base, the others interpolated onto its
  axis for fields it lacks). `experiment(name, runs, **metadata)` wraps them.
- `calibration.Calibration(*steps)` applies ordered steps and records them:
  `Linear` (`field = factor * source + offset`), `EddySlip` (eddy-current volts
  to `slip_k` in um, zeroed at the run start, plus `displacement`), `Friction`.
  `pressure_transducers(section)` gives the lab's stress conversions. A new
  conversion is a class with `apply(run, units)` and `describe()`.
- `alignment.offset_from_trigger(ni, elsys)` puts the Elsys clock on the NI
  clock from the NI trigger sample; `slip_step_table` checks that slip follows
  each PZT trigger.

The notebooks in `examples/preprocessing/` are thin scripts over this package:
paths, channel maps, the calibration, the builders, plots, save.

## Upgrading files saved by an older explorer

`labquake_explorer/data/migrate.py` brings an experiment file up to the
layouts above: run keys that were dropped, picks moved into
`event_extraction`, events reduced to the processed channels plus
`waveform/<recorder>` records (with `trigger_time` and `positions`), arrival
picks under `arrivals`, `event_analysis` records at version 3. The PSU
`strain` layout is left as it is. A copy of the original is kept next to the
file unless `--no-backup` is given:

```bash
python -m labquake_explorer.data.migrate experiment.h5
```
